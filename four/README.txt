Assignment 3 - README

The file can be ran be typing ./a4 followed by a sequence of arguments in the command line, such as input filename and output file for the bmp image. Inputs can be entered in any order, as long as -input, -size, and -output are all specified.

Files 1-9.bmp are the results of the test files. I went ahead and implemented shadowing, though 1_ws, 8_ws, and 9_ws, all are images done without shadow.
