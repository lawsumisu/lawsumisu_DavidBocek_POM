Assignment 3 - README

The file can be ran be typing ./a5 followed by a sequence of arguments in the command line, such as input filename and output file for the bmp image. Inputs can be entered in any order, as long as -input, -size, and -output are all specified.

Optional commands:
* -shadows: adds shadows to the image.
* -resolution: sets the supersampling rate of the image. Must be an integer >= 1. Defaults to 3 if omitted. 
* -jitter: Jitters the samples
* -filter: Provides Gaussian blur for down-sampling.

Collaborators ------------------------------------------------------------

* Walter Menendez: Basically tackled this problem set together.
* Arjun Narayanan: Helped me with getting reflection and refraction to work normally


Project Statement -------------------------------------------------------------------

I am working with David Bocek on trying to implement Parallax for images. The main concept is that images would make use of a depth map so that when rays intersect with the image, rather than display the color at that location, the depth map gives another location whose color the pixel should use.

Notes ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Text files for images 1-5 and 7-9 have been removed as they were no longer expected to conform to the staff solutions for Assignment 4.
